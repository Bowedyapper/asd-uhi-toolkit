        "explanation": "Make sure you EXPLAIN rather than DESCRIBE, which means you need to identify why these program managements are the way they are. Try and find other environments rather than just waterfall to compare against. Look for the original papers and manifestos of these. What you are trying to get to is not some woolly description but what is the essence of these methods and how they help deliver projects on time and on budget."

How are you going to show how you are being timely and focused - its very difficult to take your seriously if you say you are being timely and focused and you have not done anything for an entire week! To write about this authentically you need to engage with the course which will help you have experiences you can assess. What were the distrations? What did you do to mitigate them?

Staff will not organise this for you, you are better off putting in a time and date that suits you. The topic of this is up to you, it could be about your project, about something you found interesting in the news and did some research into, a programming technique - whatever. You don't have to just do 1. We would suggest doing one a semester at least so you gain confidence. They do not have to be long - 10 minutes max is perfect with 5 minutes for Q&A."

You can pick which vulnerability you wish to provide. Using a service like HackTheBox makes this trivial. You can also do the first part using some of their scenarios.

You should be looking to do some sort of continuous deployment which meets the needs of an audience. If its a fictional audience you have to justify your deployment strategy - easily done by comparing how you are doing it to other companies with real products. Ensure you reference your sources."

Write some code the exemplifies these - Java is a good language for that as its OOP by nature, but you can use any C style language. You should also then reflect how knowing about these things makes your code better/worse and your system design better/worse! You could also review an open source software package for these patterns and say how they make the code easier/worse to read/understand."

You can do this as a team or individually but you should document your activity and make sure that each of you can explain what did. You need to explain what phased contingency is? What it means to allocate resources? What it means to manage resources? You will want to say if how you went about it was valid i.e. did you follow a process? If you were not, why not?

What makes them successful or not? Find academic work that looks into their success. If writing or illustrating cite your sources with the text and give references. You might also think if you had a business in the Highlands or where you live, what method would work for you do you think and why?\nTIP:Whenever you have what looks like a dry and boring learning outcome - try and place it in a context where it could matter to you.
