These are some of the questions you should be asking yourself and of your sources. You need to EVALUATE this information, that is document the pros and cons and make a judgement of your own as to their worth. When are they not worth they effort and when are they not?"

It does NOT mean object orientated coding. What is a design methodology? What does it comprise of? What is a UML diagram? Why are they used? Where are they used in industry?

This is all about saying WHY you are making the choices you are. You have done this adhoc so far, you need to be SYSTEMATIC about this in third year. Where possible you should be looking for industry and academic literature to help add evidence and weight to your decisions.

This is asking you to PICK a methodology and USE it in a project and EVALUATE if it was any good or if another methodology might have worked better. You should be tagging many screenshots of your process and correspondence between team members.

A learning outcome like this is best done with a regular short reflection on what has gone well in the week and what did not go well. Identify problems and research solutions (reference). This is all about DEMONSTRATING you have what it takes to MANAGE a project effectively.

First you need to research what ARE the principles to building high quality software.

Whatever you choose you need to identify what the DATA is, how you are REPRESENTING it and why you are manipulating in the way that you are. This is a great learning outcome for referencing academic literature.\nNote that you need to persuade the marker what you did to DESIGN the algorithm, you cannot just plug it into a single function and say that's the design. You can however join multiple techniques together to produce an output and claim you designed that pipeline.\nTry and do something interesting such as image recognition, text analysis or something you would not normally do. You can start from a tutorial and then try and adjust the technique to a new domain for instance.\nDOCUMENT your failures as well as your successes."

What does it mean to manage someone across an organisation? How do you assess people's objectives? How does that help you manage them?

If you are in industry you might have an advantage here as you can ask to sit in with early meetings if you show interest. You need to answer the question, if someone comes to you with a problem, you are going to recommend your solution - some whizz bang techstack. How are you going to persuade the client that what you are offering will solve their problem? What are the questions you could ask? Research into selling and negotiating skills.

It includes technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Puppet, Chef, OpenShift, Ansible, package.json and similar files. Your dependencies both software, hardware and cloud move at different rates, how are you going to effectively manage that? You should think about this from the point of view of 3 stages, a dev infrastructure, a test infrastructure and a production infrastructure. Each of these is a release cycle and needs to be controlled and repeatable on a regular basis up to 100's of times a day. Case studies include companies such as Facebook and Netflix."

This is a good one to ask guest speakers about if they are talking about taking actions from data. There are numerous books and videos on making decisions from data. Is this always good? Ford supposedly said that customers did not know what they wanted until he gave it to them, so would he be persuaded by data analytics?
